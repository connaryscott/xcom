Currently for each recipe we do this:

 knife node run_list add $(hostname -f) "recipe[nexus]"
 knife node run_list add $(hostname -f) "recipe[jenkins]"

which are not aggregated into a role yet... 

we shall set that up next


#
# recipe and roles via knife
#
Node Roles
% knife node show i-12345678 -r
~/exampleorg/.chef/../cookbooks
{
  "run_list": [
    "role[couchdb]"
  ]
}
This node only has the role couchdb; if we wanted to add monitoring to that role we could add it:

% knife node run_list add i-12345678 "role[monitoring]"
~/exampleorg/.chef/../cookbooks
{
  "run_list": [
    "role[couchdb]",
    "role[monitoring]"
  ]
}
